# RedIce
RedIce - Redis Cluster Implementation Toolkit based on Redis Sentinel.

What I need:

Manage and full control for split your dataset among multiple nodes;

Multiple cluster access points (for better scalability and performance);

Dynamic and manual management of the node load level (load balancing).

A high degree of distribution may affect the Consistency Guarantee (Need production tests).

It's a bicycle, but there are things I miss in Redis Cluster. We need to start, then we'll see what's what.
